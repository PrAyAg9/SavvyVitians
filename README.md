## Description

Welcome to the **SavvyVitian** repository!, a platform designed to help engineering students excel in their academic journey. This frontend project provides an intuitive interface to access study materials, tips to pass, notes, question papers, and much more. You can also contribute to the platform by sharing your own resources to help fellow students!

## Features üßë‚Äçüíª

- **Vite**: Fast build and hot module replacement.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed development for fewer runtime errors.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Express + Ts + Postgre SQL + ORM (Sequelizer) -- Currently in Railway Server
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views.

## Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be output to the `dist` directory.

## Problem Statement ü§å

Finding the right study materials for engineering subjects can be a hassle. It aims to solve this problem by offering:

- **Modules** for every subject.
- **Tips to Pass** critical exams.
- **Notes** curated by students and teachers.
- **Previous Year Question Papers** to practice effectively.
- A platform for students to **contribute resources** and expand the collection.
  

## Deployment üôå

This project is optimized for deployment on platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Ensure you set up the following:

- Environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
- Correct build command: `vite build`.
- Output directory: `dist`.

## Environment Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
```
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

In production, configure these in your deployment platform's environment settings.
